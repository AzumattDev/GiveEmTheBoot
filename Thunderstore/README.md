# Description

### A valheim mod which empowers the unarmed kick attack. Knockback will send foes in an upward diagonal direction, dependent on their weight.

### Additional Information

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`


It is highly recommended that you edit this file using the BepInEx Configuration Manager. This will allow you to change the settings without having to edit the file directly. You can find the configuration manager at the following link: https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/

- Trolls will be slightly nudged, Greylings will be caber-tossed. Gets stronger with your unarmed skill, as well as the weight of your legwear. At 100 unarmed skill and with iron leg armor, a greyling will be yeeted 50+ feet away. It's the unarmed kick you always wanted.
- This mod empowers the unarmed kick (Middle click without a weapon, by default) by giving it increased scaling knockback and a diagonal-upwards direction. Lighter characters such as Greylings can be kicked significant distances, heavier ones such as Trolls will only be budged slightly. Kick has stronger, horizontal-only force when delivering a killing blow - beware if you actually want to collect the enemy's loot.

    - The knockback scales up in the following ways:

        - Unarmed skill, up to 50 extra force al level 100. (leveling up beyond 100 by non-vanilla means can increase this further)
        - Leg armor weight, up to 50 extra force with iron boots. (heavier boots would potentially increase this further, proportionally)
        - Bonus 25 force if the enemy is staggered while being kicked.
          (All of these values can be changed in the config, and flat, unscaling bonus can also be added. Defaults are intended for balanced gameplay.)

Flavor text will also be shown when the kick connects. If you don't like it, you can turn it off or customize it.

NEW FEATURE: Kick while holding a weapon!!! Via an optional keybind in the config file, blank by default. You will need to set it yourself.
